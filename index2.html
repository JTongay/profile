      <h1>My Background</h1>
      <p class="answer">
        I started my journey in early 2016 studying HTML and CSS, until I joined
        Thinkful and brought HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery all-together. Ever since
        I started, I have found that I enjoy writing code and problem solving.

      <h1>Why Choose Galvanize?</h1>
      <p class="answer">
        After a lot of research and interviewing at different schools, I chose
        Galvanize because of the curriculum that was taught and the schedule. I'm
        very excited to be a part of the Galvanize family and learn with you all.
      </p>
      <h1>Career Goals?</h1>
      <p class="answer">
        I haven't really thought about certain companies that I would like to work
        for or what I would like to accomplish after school. My initial goal was to get
        into a school. After Galvanize, eventually I would like to work for an
        established company and get work experience under my belt, and possibly
        join a start-up. I would like to learn as many languages as possible along
        the way, and be a part of as many projects as I can.
