    <div class="answer">
      I was born in Laguna Hills California, but was raised in Round Rock Texas.
      I have a very small family, but it has gotten much bigger since I got married
      in May of 2015. My sister is currently a web-designer for Netspend, and has
      helped sparked my interest in Web Development. My wife is currently studying
      Sociology at Texas State. <BR><button class="pic" id="erin">Show Wife</button>
